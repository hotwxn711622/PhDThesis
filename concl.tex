In this dissertation, I have presented a novel, simple, yet extremely powerful
automation engine for verifying complex system software.
Unlike traditional verification approaches for verifying C programs mixing 
the proof of isolation and preservation of invariants into the reasoning of 
functional correctness, our automation engine takes the isolation and 
invariants as given, and provide separate mechanisms to guarantee 
isolation and prove the invariants.
The formalization of interrupts follows the
same mantra and turns the realistic hardware interrupt model into
a contextually equivalent abstract model of interrupts,
such that our automation engine can effectively reason about interruptible
code independently from the interleaved executions from the interrupts.
The extended support on fine-grained concurrency allows us
to reason about each local thread with fine-grained locking separately through
our automation engine,
and formally link the local proofs to derive the global properties of
the entire system. 
To illustrate effectiveness of our approach, using all the tools, we 
have developed fully verified feature-rich operating system kernel 
with machine checkable proof in the Coq proof assistant.
